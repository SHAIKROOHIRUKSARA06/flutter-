Experiment – 1
a) Install Flutter and DART SDK
b) Write a simple Dart program to understand language basics
Aim:

To install Flutter and DART SDK.

Get the Flutter SDK
Step 1:

Download the following installation bundle to get the latest stable release of the Flutter SDK.




Step 2:

Extract the file:
Extract the downloaded ZIP file and move it to the desired location where you want to install Flutter SDK.
Do not install it in a folder or directory that requires elevated privileges (such as C:\Program Files) to ensure the program runs properly.

You are now ready to run Flutter commands in the Flutter console.




Step 3:

Update the Path variable for Windows PowerShell.

If you wish to run Flutter commands in the regular Windows console, take these steps to add Flutter to the Path environment variable:

From the Start search bar, enter env and select Edit environment variables for your account.

Start → Search “env” → Edit environment variables for your account → Control Panel → Open




Step 4:

Under User variables, check if there is an entry called Path.

If the entry exists, append the full path to flutter\bin using a separator (;) from existing values.

Environment Variable Table
Variable	Value
Path	C:\Users\Ashut\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps; C:\Users\Ashut...
Temp	C:\Users\Ashut\AppData\Local\Temp

(Buttons: [New] [Edit] [Delete])

On the next screen, click New and add the full path to your flutter\bin directory.
For this guide, it is given below. Click on both windows to enable running Flutter commands in Windows console.

Example Paths
Path Type	Example Path
%USERPROFILE%	%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps
Installed Path	C:\Users\Ashut\AppData\Local\programs\Microsoft...
Flutter Bin	C:\Development\flutter\bin

(Buttons: [New] [Edit] [Browse] [Delete])

If the entry doesn’t exist, create a new user variable named Path and set its value to the full path of flutter\bin.




Step 5: Confirm Installed Tools for Running Flutter

Open Flutter Console as Administrator.

Run the command:

flutter doctor


You can run the Flutter command from any CMD or PowerShell window.

To add Flutter to your path, refer: https://flutter.dev/setup/windows

Example Output Command:

C:\Users\Ashut>flutter doctor
Doctor summary (to see all details, run flutter doctor -v)



Step 6: Download and Install Android Studio
Download Android Studio

Visit the official Android Studio download page:
👉 https://developer.android.com/studio

Click on "Download Android Studio" button.

Next, proceed by downloading Android Studio. During the setup, unless you have unique requirements, simply click Next on all screens to keep default settings.

On the Choose Components screen, be sure to select the Android Studio option to enable an Android emulator for your app development needs.

Android Studio Setup
Select Components to Install
☑ Android Studio
☑ Android Virtual Device

(Buttons: [Back] [Next] [Cancel])

Afterward, the Android Studio setup wizard will start, and you can proceed by clicking Next.

On the Install Type screen, select Custom and click Next.

Select the installation location or leave the default path and click Next.

Android SDK (~379 MB) will be installed.

Select your UI Theme and click Next.

Installing Android Emulator Hypervisor Device will begin automatically.




Step 7: Verify Installation and Configure Plugins

Verify the selections and click Next.

On the next screen, accept the License Agreement and click Finish.

☑ android-sdk-license


The download of components will start, and Android Studio installation will complete.
After installation, click Finish.

Then, open Android Studio → Go to Plugins → Search for Flutter → Click Install to install the Flutter plugin.

Plugin Installation Prompt

It will also prompt you to install Dart, a programming language used to create Flutter apps.
Click Install when prompted.

⚠	The Flutter plugin requires Dart to be installed.
Buttons: [Install] [Cancel]	

Finally, click Restart IDE so that the plugin changes are applied.
Click Restart at the prompt to confirm this action.

Android Studio and Plugin Updates
ℹ	Restart Android Studio to apply changes in plugins.
Buttons: [Restart] [Not Now]	
Step 8: Verify Setup

After restarting, run the following command in CMD to confirm Android Studio installation:

flutter doctor


If Android Studio was successfully installed but shows an issue with Android licenses, this can be resolved by running:

flutter doctor --android-licenses


After accepting all licenses, run the flutter doctor command again — the issue should be resolved.




Installing DART SDK

Install Dart SDK in Windows
Step 1: Download Dart SDK

Download the Dart SDK from the Dart SDK Archive page.
Use this link to open the Dart SDK download page:
👉 Dart SDK Download

Stable Channel:
Stable channel builds are tested and approved for production use.

Dart SDK Versions Table
Version	OS	Architecture	Release Date	Downloads
3.7.2	Windows	X64	Mar 12, 2025	Dart SDK (SHA-256)
3.7.2	Windows	IA32	Mar 12, 2025	Dart SDK (SHA-256)
3.7.2	Windows	ARM64	Mar 12, 2025	Dart SDK (SHA-256)
3.7.2	Windows	–	Mar 12, 2025	All Docs

Click on Dart SDK to download the SDK for Windows 64-bit architecture.
The download will start and a .zip file will be downloaded.

Note: To download SDK for any other OS, select as per your choice.




Step 2: Extract the Downloaded ZIP File

Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file.
After extracting, the contents of the Dart SDK folder will appear as shown below:

Extracted Folder Contents
Name	Type	Compressed Size	Password	Size Ratio
bin	File Folder	–	–	–
include	File Folder	–	–	–
lib	File Folder	–	–	–
pkg	File Folder	–	–	–
sdk-package-config.json	File	1 KB	–	–

📁 Path:
Downloads > dart-sdk-windows-x64_release.zip > dart-sdk




Step 3: Running Dart

Now, open the bin folder and type cmd in the address bar as shown below.

CMD


This will open the Command Prompt with the current directory path of the bin folder.
Now, type the following command:

C:\>dart


Now we are ready to use Dart through the bin folder.
However, setting up the Path in the environment variable will make this process easier — allowing us to run Dart from anywhere in the file system using the Command Prompt.
